# SRP
SRP GUI for Python

Suggested "to do" list  

1) Multi-window layout (JEC)  
2) Make sure "slider" values update appropriately with selected file/session;   
    but I guess this means you need some kind of way to deal with multiple selected files with different parameters (gray out?)  
3) Add a way to create unique file name when saving data (prompt?  blank space next to?).
